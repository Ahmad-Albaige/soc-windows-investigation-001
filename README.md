# SOC Windows Investigation 001 



## \# Windows Auth Investigation (SOC style)

## 

## This repository contains a small, realistic analysis of suspicious authentication on a Windows system.

## 

## “The aim of this project is to learn and show how a newly hired SOC analyst could:”

## \- establish a baseline,

## \- observe abnormal behaviors,

## \- collect evidence,

## 

## \- and document conclusions clearly.

## 

## \## Scenario

## 

## A number of failed login attempts for the same user account were noted in a normal functioning Windows workstation before finally gaining access into the system.

## 

## This is not the baseline behavior and had to be looked into.

## 

## \## What I Did

## \- Engaged in normal user activities for understanding the basic authentication events.

## \- Analyzed Windows Security Logs through Event Viewer

## \- Noticing failed login attempts followed by a successful login attempt

## 

## \- Evidence documented apart from analysis

## 

## \- Conducted a brief assessment and developed recommendations for response

## \## Environment

## Environment

## \- Windows 10 Pro (Virtual Machine)

## 

## \- VMware Workstation
