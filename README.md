# SOC Windows Investigation 001 – Suspicious Authentication & Endpoint Activity

## Goal
Investigate a realistic Windows security scenario and document findings like a junior SOC analyst.

## What I used
- Windows VM
- Windows Event Viewer (Security logs)
- Basic triage mindset: identify → validate → scope → recommend

## Scenario (high level)
A Windows host shows abnormal authentication behavior and suspicious activity. I will determine what happened, why it matters, and what to do next.

## Deliverables
- Timeline of key events
- Indicators observed (IOCs/behaviors)
- Assessment and likely root cause
- Containment and remediation recommendations

## Notes
Setup steps are kept minimal; focus is on investigation and communication.
